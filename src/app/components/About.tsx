          Creativity is at the heart of everything I do. I view coding as an art
          form, where every line of code has the potential to be elegant and
          expressive. I value the importance of visual appeal, attention to
          detail, and believe in the power that blending creativity and
          technology has.
        </p>
        <p className="about-me-p">
          As a coding bootcamp graduate, I have developed a strong aptitude for
          fast learning, enabling me to quickly grasp new concepts and
          technologies. I thrive on the excitement of exploring and mastering
          cutting-edge tools and frameworks, continuously expanding my skillset.
        </p>
        <p className="about-me-p">
          Beyond the code, I am an artist who loves expressing myself through
          digital mediums. I also enjoy getting out into nature, spending
          quality time with my dog and partner, and diving into the immersive
          worlds of video games when itâ€™s time to unwind.
